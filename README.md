Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented using Python. The projects cover different algorithms and tasks, including Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Adaline, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).


Contents
Perceptron:

Binary classification using Perceptron algorithm.
Predicts gender based on height and weight data.


Adaline:

Linear classification using the Adaline learning rule.
Demonstrates the effect of learning rate and epochs on model performance.


Logistic Regression:

Binary and multi-class classification.
Visualization of decision boundaries and cost function.


Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Implementation of SVM with RBF kernel.
Exploration of hyperparameter effects on decision boundaries.
